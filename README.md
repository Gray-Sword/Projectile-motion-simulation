# Projectile-motion-simulation
This project simulates projectile motion by solving equations of motion for a launched object. Users input initial velocity, angle, and height. It optionally includes air resistance. The trajectory is visualized in a graph using Python's matplotlib, showing physics in action.
## How to Use
1. Run the script using any Python environment.
2. Enter the following inputs when prompted:
   - **Initial velocity (m/s)**: Speed of the projectile.
   - **Launch angle (degrees)**: Angle of launch with respect to the horizontal axis.
   - **Initial height (m)**: The starting height of the projectile from the ground.
   - **Air resistance**: Choose whether to include air resistance by typing `yes` or `no`.
3. After providing the inputs, the program calculates the trajectory and plots the motion on a graph.

## Example Inputs
- **Initial velocity**: `20 m/s`
- **Launch angle**: `45 degrees`
- **Initial height**: `0 m`
- **Air resistance**: `no`
